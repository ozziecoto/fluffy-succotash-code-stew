A test repository

I am excited to dive into github. Been an avid reader of code over the years. Now I am going to begin using github all the time. This will be fun. :)

I am using github to write out a set of short courses that I will be teaching online. The courses will solve for life-issues we humans face at different times.

My focus is on Overoming Adversity. I have had 5 decades-worth of experiences on earth and I am ready to share the wisdom.

But first, I must build out the infrastructure I will need to manage the development of the content. I want to give a huge "Thank You!!" to all the women and men who have contributed to, and built, all the tools that comprise this sweet version control system.

Have yourself a good day. I trust that if you ever ome across this repo, I hope that you take a good look at your life and know that you are, in fact, worthy of happiness, tranquility, and love. :)

Peace to you and yours.
